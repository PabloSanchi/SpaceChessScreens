# 🚀 SPACE CHESS

A Newspace related visualization project in collaboration with Hydra-Space.    
The basic idea is to use the Liquid Galaxy cluster as a visualizer of a world chess game that will happen with people around the world and through satellite communications, a world&apos;s first !!!

Two teams, the Earth (🌎)(you) and the Space (🛰️) (a strong AI) <br/>
Every day the Earth makes one move (at least), the most common move between you all, so play as a community and
not as an individual.

Once the Earth has made the move, wait for the Space.
The satellite may take a while to make its move, so you may not see it in hours, so be patient.

## <a name="req" ></a>✏️ Requirements

1. Make sure the Liquid Galaxy core is installed. Check out the git hub [repository](https://github.com/LiquidGalaxyLAB/liquid-galaxy)
2. Make sure **Node.js version 16** is installed on the master machine by running:
```bash
node -v
```
-  The output should look someting like `v16.*.*`, at least you need version `v14.*.*`, if this is not the case it may not work, if not, try upgrading to the version 16.

3. Install pm2 on master machine. Run command:
```bash
sudo npm i -g pm2
```
4. Make sure Chromium Browser is installed on all machines.
